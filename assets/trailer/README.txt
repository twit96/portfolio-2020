Team 13 Game Trailer
Elements of Game Development with Professor Toprac
12/3/2019



Root Folder:
	* There are 4 folders (described below) and 3 files in this folder.

	'team-13_trailer' is the final trailer we will show in class! Woo Hoo!

	'README.txt', why hello there!

	The Windows Video Editor file 'team-13_trailer.vpb' in case we need to
	edit it before class or want to go back and check it out at a later date.



Audio Folder:
	* There are 3 versions of each of the audio files: the original audio,
	the FL Studio project file I made to tweak the original, and the updated
	audio file in case we need to go back to any of this later on.
	* There are 3 audio files:

		File Name: 'background1'
		Original Audio Name: 'Ancient Egyptian Music - Tomb of the
		Ancients' by Fantasy & World Music by the Fiechters
		Link to Audio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI6dOS5ncFc
		Changes Made: I used the 'background1' audio file from our game's
		assets and then used FL Studio to trim the file down to a few
		seconds, slow it down, lower the pitch, and used an automation
		clip to fade out the volume for the end of our trailer.

		File Name: 'Falling-Debris'
		Original Audio Name: 'Dust and Debris Falling' (Falling Debris Dust
		And Glass A1 Sound Effect (Outside Version))
		Link to Audio: https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-sound-
		effects-download/dust-and-debris-falling-146
		Changes Made: I used an FL Studio automation clip to have the audio
		volume fade out.

		File Name: 'Villainous'
		Original Audio Name: "Villainous" by David Fesliyan (30 Second
		Version)
		Link to Audio: https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/
		download/villainous/397
		Changes Made: I used FL Studio to splice it and have part of the
		middle repeat to make the audio closer to 45 seconds for our
		trailer. Never done that before but you can't tell I extended it!

	* 'Villainous' and 'Falling-Debris' are cited in the credits of our trailer
	since they are not a part of our game's audio asset files (the website asked
	that we put 'Royalty free music from https://www.fesliyanstudios.com' as a
	citation in whatever project we used them on).


Miscellaneous Logo Files Folder:
	* This just includes the logo files Professor Toprac provided us that we
	didn't use for our trailer. Not sure why I kept them but here we are.


Photos Folder:
	A black background used on the intro, text, and credits slides.

	The logo Professor Toprac provided us that we did use in our trailer.

	'titleCropped' is a cropped version of 'titleSlide', which is used on our project's main README.md file.

	'titleSlide' was made with a cropped screenshot of our menu scene, and
	placed on the black background with Windows Paint 3D. Tricky stuff lol


Videos Folder:
	I have left all individual video clips used in the trailer in this folder.
	They are numbered in the order they appear in the trailer and named based
	off of where in the game they were recorded.

	* I used this awesome website for both trimming and cropping all of the
	videos: https://online-video-cutter.com/



That's everything for the Game Trailer folder! This has been a really awesome
class. I learned a lot and had a lot of fun, and I hope y'all enjoyed working
on the project as well! Our game would be nowhere near where it is without
Devyn's aesthetics, Grey's spritesheets, and Amber's programming. Thanks for
being an awesome team! I wish y'all the best and hope to stay in touch after
this semester.
