							The initial versions of the assets are finished, the player
              controls are fully functional, and the last known bug has been
              squashed in the otherwise empty test world. At this stage of
              development, your game’s core is far from complete. So before
              considering what will replace the test world, the next obvious
              question is: how should you go about programming the various
              interactive elements – such as characters, enemies, weapons, and
              collectibles – for your game? The most likely answer is in using
              classes.

						<h3 id="two">So, what is a class?</h3>
			      <p>
							Let’s say you have never heard of classes before. Or maybe you
              have but need a refresher. Certain programming languages – such
              as Python, JavaScript, C++, and Java, for instance – are known as
              object-oriented programming languages. Object-Oriented
              programming, or OOP for short, is a method of programming in
              which templates of code – each with unique behaviors and
              attributes – are used to organize and develop software. These
              code templates are called classes, and you can think of them like
              code factories. This is because we can create instances of a
              class – as many as we want, in fact – that all function and be
              modified independently of one another, but that each are
              identical to the class we made it from. These instances are known
              as objects, which is where object-oriented programming gets its
              name from! So in OOP, we program classes (or code
              templates/factories) from which we can later create objects
              (which are class instances, or factory outputs).

						<h3 id="three">But how do classes work?</h3>
			      <p>
			        There are four main principles to object-oriented programming –
              encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism – which
              together summarize the way in which a class is designed and in
              which the relationship between classes is structured.
			      </p>
            <p>
              When designing a class, there are certain behaviors and
              attributes you will want accessible by other objects, and
              conversely there may be others you will not. Hiding behaviors
              and attributes makes up the principle of encapsulation, whereas
              exposing behaviors and attributes that are relevant or useful to
              other objects makes up the principle of abstraction. Together
              these two principles summarize the way in which we design a class
              in OOP – by hiding or exposing certain aspects of each class as
              necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              After designing one class, we may want a second class that has
              all the same behaviors and attributes as the first, plus a few
              extras of its own. We can achieve exactly this by making the
              second class a child of the first class. This makes up the
              principle of inheritance. We may also, for example, need the
              same method to behave differently in different classes. This is
              achieved by defining the method in each of the classes with the
              necessary unique behavior. We can then call this one method
              name while iterating over a mixed group of objects from these
              classes without error. This idea makes up the principle of
              polymorphism. Furthermore, a child class can redeclare a method
              from its parent class to override the functionality of the
              method if needed, a combination of inheritance and
              polymorphism. Together these two principles summarize the way
              in which we structure the relationships between classes in
              OOP – by extending the functionality of a class in its children
              and by modifying or overriding the functionality of one class
              in another.

						<h3 id="four">Using Classes</h3>
						<p>
              Thus, classes are extremely useful in creating reusable building
              blocks to make up larger software projects. And this makes them
              particularly useful when programming various interactive elements
              of a game, since instances can be created in any case where an
              element of a specific type should appear. Furthermore, utilizing
              parent-child relationships can give rise to game elements such as
              similar enemies with varying complexities and difficulties.

              In the next article, we will strip away most of the jargon and
              focus on what applying classes in a game development setting
              looks like.
