			<!-- Overview -->
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				The most challenging and rewarding class I have taken in my college
				degree was a Game Development class I took in the Fall of 2019. Unlike
				my other prior classes, this class centered entirely around a single
				semester-long group project, which in the case of my group was a 2D
				platformer game called "Pharaoh's Phury".
			</p>
			<p>
				The professor's aim was to layout the class as if it were a job, and
				my group ended up communicating nearly every day of every week over
				the course of the semester in order to meet the assigned weekly sprint
				deadlines and to keep our project on track. As the group dynamics
				stabilized, I settled into the roles of lead programmer and often
				worked as a project coordinator in order to integrate and organize
				everyone's work into our codebase and project files during each sprint.

			<h2>My Work</h2>
			<p>
				<b>Sprint 1. Hardest Challenge</b><br />
				For the first week of developing Pharaoh's Phury, my group worked to
				flesh out the game's player and final boss characters, a mummy and a
				tank, respectively. My work was in programming classes to represent
				the basic attributes, behaviors, and controls of each of these
				characters.<br /><br />

				<b>Sprint 2. Art</b><br />
				With our Mummy and Tank characters designed, we moved our focus to
				designing the visual aspects of Pharaoh's Phury. This included
				spritesheets for characters, tile sets to use in the levels, and
				various UI elements. I worked alongside everyone to integrate these
				assets into our game to replace the placeholder assets we had been
				using.<br /><br />

				<b>Sprint 3. Core</b><br />
				To build up a stronger core for our game, we added more functionality
				to the classes representing the characters, and added a better UI for
				the game. I worked to add classes into our code base to represent new
				enemy characters, and worked on how all of the character classes could
				interact with one another. At this stage, my group ran into a problem
				of organization. Additions to the code base from different members of
				the group didn't adhere to the same structure and naming conventions,
				and our file structure was messy. As such, I cleaned and reorganized,
				and rewrote code within nearly all of our files before we added
				anything else to the project.<br /><br />

				<b>Sprint 4. Pre-Alpha</b><br />

				<b>Sprint 5. Mid-Way</b><br />

				<b>Sprint 6. Alpha</b><br />

				<b>Sprint 7. Alpha Fix</b><br />

				<b>Sprint 8. Beta</b><br />

				<b>Sprint 9. Beta Fix</b><br />

				<b>Sprint 10. Final Polish</b><br />

				<b>Sprint 11. Release to Distribution</b><br />
